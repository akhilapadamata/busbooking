&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Mumbai is the capital of the Indian state of  Maharashtra.Along with the neighbouring regions of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it is the second most populous metropolitan area in India.
<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour.
The architecture of the city is a blend of Gothic Revival, Indo-Saracenic, Art Deco, and other contemporary styles. Most of the buildings during the British period, such as the Victoria Terminus and Bombay University, were built in Gothic Revival style.
There are also a few Indo-Saracenic styled buildings such as the Gateway of India.Art Deco styled landmarks can be found along the Marine Drive and west of the Oval Maidan. Mumbai has the second largest number of Art Deco buildings in the world after Miami.

<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Mumbai has two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and the Elephanta Caves. In the south of Mumbai, there are colonial-era buildings and Soviet-style offices.
There are 31 buildings taller than 100 m, compared with 200 in Shanghai, 500 in Hong Kong and 500 in New York.
